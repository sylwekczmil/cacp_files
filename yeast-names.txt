Yeast data set

1: Description.

This database contains information about a set of Yeast cells. The task is to determine the localization site of each cell among 10 possible alternatives. 

Attributes description: 
- Mcg: McGeoch's method for signal sequence recognition. 
- Gvh: von Heijne's method for signal sequence recognition. 
- Alm: Score of the ALOM membrane spanning region prediction program. 
- Mit: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of the N-terminal region (20 residues long) of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins. 
- Erl: Presence of "HDEL" substring (thought to act as a signal for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen). Binary attribute. 
- Pox: Peroxisomal targeting signal in the C-terminus. 
- Vac: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of vacuolar and extracellular proteins. 
- Nuc: Score of discriminant analysis of nuclear localization signals of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins.
