Post-Operative data set

1: Description.

The classification task of this database is to determine where patients in a postoperative recovery area should be sent to next. Because hypothermia is a significant concern after surgery, the attributes correspond roughly to body temperature measurements. 

The class label can take one of the following values: I (patient sent to Intensive Care Unit), S (patient prepared to go home), A (patient sent to general hospital floor). 

Attributes description: 

1. L-CORE (patient's internal temperature in C): high (> 37), mid (>= 36 and <= 37), low (< 36) 
2. L-SURF (patient's surface temperature in C): high (> 36.5), mid (>= 36.5 and <= 35), low (< 35) 
3. L-O2 (oxygen saturation in %): excellent (>= 98), good (>= 90 and < 98), fair (>= 80 and < 90), poor (< 80) 
4. L-BP (last measurement of blood pressure): high (> 130/90), mid (<= 130/90 and >= 90/70), low (< 90/70) 
5. SURF-STBL (stability of patient's surface temperature): stable, mod-stable, unstable 
6. CORE-STBL (stability of patient's core temperature): stable, mod-stable, unstable 
7. BP-STBL (stability of patient's blood pressure): stable, mod-stable, unstable 
8. COMFORT (patient's perceived comfort at discharge)
